Basic tests for rotfs.
For Testing you need to do following steps:

1- make all                (rotfs will be compiled for you)
2- make test               (the testsetup is compiled for you)
3- ./rotfs_main from to    (mount rotfs)
4- ./test_main             (run the test)

To clean up after testing you can run:
make clean_test

To unount the filesystem you can run:
fusermount -u to
